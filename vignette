This is the Introduction to the gradeR package, which is developed by Vidhi Jani to offer simple tools to work with student performance data. The package 
was developed as part of the final project for an R programming class 
and covers the following areas: Building a correct DESCRIPTION file (Module 10) Implementing 'defensive programming' in 
R functions (Module 11) Using R Markdown to document the package (Module 12) 
The chosen dataset for this project is the Kaggle Student Performance Data Set. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set 
This dataset includes student grades (G1, G2, G3) along with demographic and social factors. Example Data To keep the vignette self-contained, 
we will create a small data frame that mimics the real Kaggle dataset structure. student_data <- data.frame( student_id = 1:10, G3 = c(10, 12, 14, 15, 9, 11, 16, 18, 13, 8), 
studytime = c(2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 2, 1) ) student_data Checking the Grade Column (Defensive Programming) The check_grade_column() function ensures that: 
The data frame is valid The requested grade column exists The grade column is numeric library(gradeR) check_grade_column(student_data, "G3") Summary of Grades (S3 Class) 
The grade_summary() function returns a simple summary: summary_result <- grade_summary(student_data, "G3") summary_result Plotting Grades 
The plot_grades() function provides a simple histogram of the grade distribution using ggplot2. plot_grades(student_data, "G3")

To use the real dataset in your own analysis, download the CSV from Kaggle and read it like this: full_data <- read.csv("student-por.csv", sep = ";") plot_grades(full_data, "G3") 
summary_result <- grade_summary(full_data, "G3") This vignette demonstrates how to: Validate a grade column Summarize student grades Plot grade distributions Apply defensive 
programming
